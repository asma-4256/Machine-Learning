 Parameters in Machine Learning:

🔹 Types of Parameters:

Model Parameters:

    These are learned from the data during training, such as:
    𝐖𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬: Determine the importance of features.
    𝐁𝐢𝐚𝐬: Adjusts the output along with the weights to better fit the data.

 🔹 Weights:

    📌Define how much influence an input has on the output.
    📌Adjusted during training to minimize the loss function and improve predictions.


 🔹 Bias:

    📌An offset value added to the model.
    📌Helps the model make accurate predictions by shifting the activation function.

Hyperparameters:

    These are set before training and control the learning process, such as:
    𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞: Determines how quickly a model learns.
    𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐄𝐩𝐨𝐜𝐡𝐬: Specifies how many times the model will see the entire dataset during training.

 📌 Learning Rate:

    Controls how quickly the model learns.

 📌 Number of Epochs:

    Determines how many times the model will see the entire dataset during training.

Methods of Hyper Tuning:

📌GridSearchCV 🔍

    Tries all possible hyperparameter combinations.

    Best for smaller datasets with fewer hyperparameters.

    Downside? Computationally expensive for large datasets.

📌RandomizedSearchCV 🎯

    Randomly selects a subset of hyperparameter combinations.

    Best for large datasets where exhaustive search is impractical.

    Faster & efficient, with a good chance of finding optimal values.

✨Which one to choose?

        ✅If speed matters → Use RandomizedSearchCV

        ✅If accuracy is top priority → Use GridSearchCV (for smaller models)


        

🔄 Model Training Steps :

        1.Preprocess Data – Clean, encode, scale, and split.

        2.Feed Data – Pass inputs and labels into the model.

        3.Forward Pass – Model makes predictions.

        4.Loss Calculation – Compare predictions with actual values.

        5.Backpropagation – Compute gradients (errors).

        6.Weight Update – Adjust model weights using optimization (e.g., gradient descent).

        7.Repeat – Do this for many epochs until loss decreases.

        8.Validate – Check performance on validation data to avoid overfitting.
