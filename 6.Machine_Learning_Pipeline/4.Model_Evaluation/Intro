Model Evaluation Metrics in Classification!

   Evaluating the performance of a classification model using some important metrics. Here's a quick breakdown:

ðŸ“ŒConfusion Matrix
    A 2x2 table that shows:

    True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted positives

    True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted negatives

    False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted positives

    False Negatives (FN): Incorrectly predicted negatives

ðŸ“ŒPrecision:

    Tells us how many of the predicted positives were actually correct.
    Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
    Useful when false positives are costly.
    Example: Predicting whether an email is spam.

ðŸ“ŒRecall (Sensitivity)
    Tells us how many actual positives were correctly identified.
    Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
    Important when missing positives is risky.
    Example: Detecting a disease in medical diagnosis.

ðŸ“ŒF1 Score
    A balance between Precision & Recall
    F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
    Great when you need a trade-off between Precision and Recall.
