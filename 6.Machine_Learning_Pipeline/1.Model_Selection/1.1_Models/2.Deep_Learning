1. Genrative Adversarial Networks :
  GAN's useful for generating new data samples that resemble existing data.
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning model used for generating new, realistic data similar to a given dataset.

  💡 Core Idea:
    GANs consist of two neural networks that compete against each other:

    Generator (G):

        Creates fake data from random noise.

        Goal: Fool the discriminator into thinking fake data is real.

    Discriminator (D):

        Tries to distinguish between real data (from the dataset) and fake data (from the generator).

        Goal: Correctly classify real vs. fake.

    They train adversarially — as one improves, the other must get better too.

  ⚙️ How GANs work (step-by-step):
    Generator produces fake data.

    Discriminator gets both real and fake data.

    Discriminator outputs a probability of real vs. fake.

Based on feedback, both models update:

    Generator improves at producing realistic data.

    Discriminator improves at detecting fakes.

    Repeat until the generator becomes so good that the discriminator can no longer tell real from fake (50% guess).

  🧠 Use Cases of GANs:
    Image generation (e.g., DeepFake, faces, art)

    Data augmentation

    Image-to-image translation (e.g., sketches to photos)

    Super-resolution (enhancing image quality)

    Music and video generation
