    📌Choosing the right model depends on:
    The specific task (classification, regression, etc.).
    📌The model's nature and complexity.
    The characteristics of the dataset being used.

    When evaluating machine learning models, K-Fold Cross-Validation randomly splits data into K subsets. 
    But here’s the problem: If the dataset is imbalanced, some folds might miss out on minority class examples, leading to unreliable model performance.

    That’s where Stratified K-Fold comes in! 🚀 It ensures each fold has the same proportion of classes as the original dataset, 
        making it a better choice for classification tasks, especially when dealing with imbalanced data.

 💡 Tip: If you're using cross_val_score() from Scikit-Learn, It automatically applies Stratified K-Fold for 
        classification and K-Fold for regression, saving you time and effort.

 🔍 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗲: For classification tasks, always prefer Stratified K-Fold to get more reliable model performance! ✅
