Math is the backbone of ML, and itâ€™s exciting to see how concepts like:
    ðŸ”¸ Linear Algebra
    ðŸ”¸ Calculus
    ðŸ”¸ Probability & Statistics
    play a crucial role in building and optimizing models.

LINEAR ALGEBRA:-

ðŸ”¹ Vector operations:
    Addition
    Subtraction
    Scalar Multiplication
    ðŸ”¹ Visualized vectors and their operations using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better understanding.

ðŸ”¹ Dot Product: Calculating the similarity or alignment between two vectors.
ðŸ”¹ Cross Product: Finding a vector perpendicular to two given vectors (useful in 3D spaces).
ðŸ”¹ Projection: Projecting one vector onto another to understand components along a direction.

I implemented these operations using NumPy, which made the calculations smooth and efficient.



ðŸ”¹ Creating MATRIXES using NumPy, including:

    Matrices with random values
    Matrices with random integers
    Zero matrices and ones matrices
    Identity matrices using eye()
    
ðŸ”¹ Matrix Transpose: Understanding how to flip rows and columns for operations like dot products and transformations.

ðŸ”¹ Matrix Addition and Subtraction: Combining or comparing data stored in matrices.
ðŸ”¹ Matrix Multiplication: Understanding how two matrices interact and generate a new one.
ðŸ”¹ Scalar Multiplication: Scaling all elements of a matrix by a constant.
ðŸ”¹ Element-wise Multiplication: Multiplying matrices element by element (useful for certain ML operations).
